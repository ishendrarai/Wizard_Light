## 🖱️ Usage

### First-time setup

1. **Add your bulb(s)** — Type the IP address of each WiZ bulb into the **Bulbs** field and click **+ Add** (e.g. `192.168.0.100`). Repeat for every bulb you want to sync.
2. **Select your monitor** — Pick the display you want to capture from the dropdown.
3. **Tune your settings** — Adjust FPS, brightness, saturation, gamma, color temperature, smoothing, and extraction mode.
4. **Click START SYNC** — All bulbs will immediately begin mirroring your screen.

### Controls overview

## 🎨 Color Extraction Modes

### Dominant (Histogram)

Quantises pixels into an 8×8×8 color bin grid and returns the center of the most-populated non-dark bin. Significantly faster than KMeans with comparable color accuracy — best for movies and games with distinct color regions.

### Average

Simple mean of all pixels in the captured frame. Lowest CPU usage — ideal if performance is a priority.

### Edge Weighted

Weights pixels near the edges and borders of the screen more heavily. Great for content where the action sits at the frame edges (widescreen cinema, racing games).

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

Settings are auto-saved to `ambienz_config.json` next to `AmbienZ.py` whenever the app closes, and loaded automatically on next launch.

## 🧠 How It Works

AmbienZ runs a high-frequency capture loop in a background QThread:

```
Screen Frame (mss)
      │
      ▼
Resize to 160×90          (fast, low-memory processing)
      │
      ▼
Crop black bars           (threshold-based edge detection)
      │
      ▼
Color extraction          (Histogram Dominant / Average / Edge Weighted)
      │
      ▼
Linear RGB conversion     (sRGB → linear, γ=2.2)
      │
      ▼
Gamma correction          (user-adjustable exponent, 0.8–2.2)
      │
      ▼
Saturation boost          (scaled in linear RGB space)
      │
      ▼
Color temperature         (Kelvin white-point via Tanner Helland piecewise fit,
                           normalised to D65 / 6 500 K, applied in linear light)
      │
      ▼
Exponential smoothing     (blends current frame with previous)
      │
      ▼
Frame-skip check          (skip if Δcolor < threshold)
      │
      ▼
UDP → WiZ Bulb(s)         (setPilot JSON over port 38899, all IPs)
```

The WiZ protocol is a simple JSON-over-UDP API on port `38899`. No cloud required.

### Color Temperature module (`color_temperature.py`)

The standalone `color_temperature.py` module provides the white-point math:

- **`kelvin_to_multipliers(kelvin)`** — returns `(r_mul, g_mul, b_mul)` normalised to 1.0 at 6 500 K (D65). Used directly by the sync loop.
- **`adjust_color_temperature(image, kelvin)`** — full image adjustment pipeline with gamma encode/decode. Useful for batch processing.
- **`build_kelvin_lut()`** / **`lut_lookup()`** — pre-computed LUT with linear interpolation for tight loops.

---

## 🔔 System Tray

Minimizing the window hides AmbienZ to the system tray — sync continues running in the background. A notification confirms it's still active.

- **Double-click** the tray icon to restore the window
- **Right-click** for a menu with _Show Settings_ and _Quit AmbienZ_

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

| Problem                     | Solution                                                                       |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Bulb not responding         | Confirm the bulb and PC are on the same Wi-Fi network and the IP is correct    |
| Wrong IP entered            | Find the correct IP using the WiZ app or your router's device list (see below) |
| High CPU usage              | Switch to **Average** mode, or lower the **FPS** slider                        |
| Colors feel washed out      | Increase **Saturation Boost** (try 2.0–2.5×)                                   |
| Too much flickering         | Increase **Smoothing** toward 0.9                                              |
| Slow / laggy response       | Lower **Smoothing** to 0.2–0.4, or raise **FPS**                               |
| Colors too dark/bright      | Adjust the **Gamma** slider — lower values brighten, higher values darken      |
| Bulb looks too warm/cool    | Use the **Color Temp** slider — 6 500 K is neutral daylight; decrease for warmer amber tones, increase for cooler blue tones |
| Monitor not listed          | Reconnect the display and restart the app                                      |
| Settings not saved          | Ensure the app is closed normally (not force-quit)                             |
| `color_temperature` import error | Ensure `color_temperature.py` is in the same folder as `AmbienZ.py`      |

## 📡 Finding Your Bulb's IP

### Option 1 — WiZ mobile app _(easiest)_

`App → Device → Settings → Device Info → IP Address`

### Option 2 — Router admin panel

Log into your router (usually `192.168.0.1` or `192.168.1.1`) and look for a device named **WiZ** or **ESP** in the connected devices list.

### Option 3 — ARP table (Windows)

If the bulb is already on your network, open Command Prompt and run:

```
arp -a
```

Look for an entry with a MAC address starting with `d8:a0:1d` or `a8:bb:50` — these are common WiZ/Espressif prefixes.

### Option 4 — Network scanner

Use [Advanced IP Scanner](https://www.advanced-ip-scanner.com/) (Windows) or run:

```bash
nmap -sn 192.168.0.0/24
```

Replace `192.168.0.0/24` with your actual subnet if different (e.g. `192.168.1.0/24`).

Once you have the IP, enter it into the **Bulbs** field and click **+ Add**.

---

## 🖥️ Finding Your PC's IP Address

Your PC and the WiZ bulb must be on the **same local network** (same router/Wi-Fi). Use your PC's IP to confirm this — both should share the same first three octets (e.g. `192.168.0.x`).

### Windows

```
ipconfig
```

Look for **IPv4 Address** under your active network adapter (Wi-Fi or Ethernet).

### macOS

```bash
ipconfig getifaddr en0
```

Use `en1` instead if you're on Ethernet.

### Linux

```bash
ip a
```

Look for `inet` under your active interface (e.g. `wlan0` or `eth0`).

> **Example:** If your PC's IP is `192.168.0.50` and your bulb's IP is `192.168.0.100`, you're on the same subnet — everything should work. If they don't share the first three octets, check that both devices are connected to the same router.

## 🤝 Contributing

Contributions are welcome!

### Setting up for development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ishendrarai/AmbienZ.git
cd AmbienZ
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate   # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python AmbienZ.py   # verify the app launches correctly before making changes
```

### Workflow

1. **Open an issue first** — describe the bug or feature before writing code, so we can discuss approach
2. Fork the repository
3. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
4. Make your changes and test them manually
5. Format your code with [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/): `black .`
6. Commit: `git commit -m "Add your feature"`
7. Push: `git push origin feature/your-feature-name`
8. Open a Pull Request with a clear description of what changed and why

### Code style

- **Formatter:** [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/) (default settings)
- **Naming:** `snake_case` for variables and functions, `PascalCase` for Qt widget subclasses
- Keep UI logic in the `MainWindow` class; keep color math in dedicated modules

### Ideas for contributions

- [ ] Kalman filter for temporal stabilization
- [ ] Scene presets (Movie / Gaming / Music / Ambient)
- [ ] Custom screen region selector (drag-to-select)
- [ ] Audio reactive mode (mic input → color)
- [ ] Explicit bulb off-command when screen goes dark
- [ ] WLED / Govee / Tapo protocol support
